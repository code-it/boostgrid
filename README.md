boostgrid
=========
BoostGrid is a very easy and rich data grid view built with PHP, the main reason to create new
one from scratch and not to work with existing one is the lack of documentations and some of
them has stopped it's life dev cycle, other reason is that most of grid data work with the
database like mysql directly so I can't work with other database engine like Oracle.


The main features:
• Built for codeIgniter (I will make a general version ASAP).
• Accept Array as data source.
• History support via URL for pagination, sorting and search results.
• Live search.
• Sorting for one column (I will make it for multi column ASAP).
• Support right to left RTL.
• Flexible controls button.
• Ajax (no need to tell more).
